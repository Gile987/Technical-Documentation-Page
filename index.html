					CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
					pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains
					what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key
					terms about the language.

        <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content
					with its style information. It processes the document in a number of
					stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very
					simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage,
					and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways.
					But this is roughly what happens.
				</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
          <li>
						It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model).
						The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.
						The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
					</li>
					<li>
						The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked
						to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ...
						and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the
						process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
					</li>
					<li>
						The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different
						rules by their selector types into different "buckets",
						e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it
						finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes
						in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required
						(this intermediate step is called a render tree).
					</li>
					<li>
						The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear
						in after the rules have been applied to it.
					</li>
					<li>
						The visual display of the page is shown on the screen
						(this stage is called painting).
					</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
					A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute,
					and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in
					the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship
					to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and
					child nodes have siblings.
				</p>
				<code>In the context of the DOM, a node is a single point in the node
					tree. Various things that are nodes are the document itself,
					elements, text, and comments.
				</code>
				<p>
					Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your
					CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content
					meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be
					navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules
					apply.

        <p>
					Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's look at an example
					to see how a real HTML snippet is converted into a DOM.
				</p>
        <p>Take the following HTML code:</p>
				<code>&lt;p>
						Let's use:
						&lt;span>Cascading&lt;/span>
						&lt;span>Style&lt;/span>
						&lt;span>Sheets&lt;/span>
					&lt;/p>
				</code>
				<p>
					In the DOM, the node corresponding to our &lt;p> element is a
					parent. Its children are a text node and the three nodes
					corresponding to our &lt;span> elements. The SPAN nodes are also
					parents, with text nodes as their children:
				</p>
				<code>P
					├─ "Let's use:"
					├─ SPAN
					|  └─ "Cascading"
					├─ SPAN
					|  └─ "Style"
					└─ SPAN
					&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ "Sheets"
				</code>
				<p>
					This is how a browser interprets the previous HTML snippet
					—it renders the above DOM tree and then outputs it in the browser
					like so:
				</p>
				<p class="result">
					Let's use:
					<span>Cascading</span>
					<span>Style</span>
					<span>Sheets</span>
				</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="applying_css_to_the_dom">
      <header>Applying CSS to the DOM</header>
      <article class="main-article">
        <p>
					Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it.
					Again, the HTML is as follows:
				</p>
        <code>&lt;p>
					&nbsp;Let's use:
					&nbsp;&lt;span>Cascading&lt;/span>
					&nbsp;&lt;span>Style&lt;/span>
					&nbsp;&lt;span>Sheets&lt;/span>
					&lt;/p>
				</code>
        <p>Let's suppose we apply the following CSS to it:</p>
				<code>span {
						&nbsp;border: 1px solid white;
						&nbsp;background-color: lime;
						&nbsp;color: #000;
					}
				</code>
				<p>
					The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it, then
					parse the CSS. Since the only rule available in the CSS has a
					span selector, the browser will be able to sort the CSS very
					quickly! It will apply that rule to each one of the three &lt;span>s,
					then paint the final visual representation to the screen.
				</p>
				<p>The updated output is as follows:</p>
				<p class="result">Let's use: <span class="span-example">Cascading</span> <span class="span-example">Style</span> <span class="span-example">Sheets</span>
				</p>
